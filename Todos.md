# Implementation List

1. ~~Array copy a range~~ (done) [Sritish]
    - takes indices and returns an subarray

2. ~~Array Printing~~ (done) [Sritish]
    (Sumit)

3. ~~Merge Sort~~ (Done) [Sritish]
    - Takes a src arr, returns an dynamic array location of the sorted array.
    - Note: User is responsible to free that dynamic sorted array

4. ~~Bubble Sort~~ (Done) [kaushik]
    - Takes an array and sort it using bubble sort

5. Need proper abstraction for function_impl functions. 
    So that the actual functions won't be directly accessed and we can only use them through the macro wrapper. 
    - Need proper scope defining. (Something like this)
    - If not here will implement this for the arraylist class.

6. Random array generator. 
    - similar to np.random.randrang() and np.random.randint()
